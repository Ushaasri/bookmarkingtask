    Faith is a state of mind that you must learn to cultivate. Through repeating affirmations and instructions, a state of faith is created in the subconscious thanks to the process of auto-suggestion.
     Any impulse of thought that is continuously repeated and entered into the subconscious mind eventually becomes a continuous loop of thought.

    <br>Within your imagination is where all plans are created and formed. 
    The only limitation you face depends on how much you develop your imagination.
     According to Hill, there are two types of imagination: synthetic and creative.

    <br>To put your plan into action, Hill recommends following these four Think and Grow Rich steps:

    Ally yourself with a Master Mind group that consists of people who will help you carry out your plan. 
    However, before assembling the group, be sure to ascertain what it is you can offer each of the members in return for their work.
    Meet with the group at least twice a week, or more if possible, until a solid plan has been created.

    <br>Persistence is built upon strength of will. When desire is combined with willpower, little can stop you from reaching your goals. Most give up the minute things get too challenging. 
    To persist in the face of adversity is the only way to advance. 
    If you find yourself struggling with a lack of persistence, by putting in some concerted effort, you can overcome this hurdle. 
    How easily you’ll be able to persist depends exclusively on how intense your desire to reach your goals is.
     Here, Hill suggests reminding yourself of your daily affirmations.
     Further, if you have carefully assembled your Master Mind group, they can prove beneficial in encouraging you to stay on track.

Further, if you have carefully assembled your Master Mind group, they can prove beneficial in encouraging you to stay on track. 

     Hill puts forward an eight-stage Think and Grow Rich action plan to cultivate persistence.
      It goes as follows:
     
     Definiteness of purpose: Knowing exactly what you want.
     Desire: Becoming obsessed with amassing your monetary fortune.
     Self-reliance: Belief that you can follow your plan increases your persistence.
     Definiteness of plans: Organized, thorough plans guide you forward.
     Accurate knowledge: Ensuring that your plans are based on fact.
     Co-operation: Members of your Master Mind can encourage you to persist.
     Willpower: Concentrating your attention on seeing your plans
